- Because of this example, I wanted to make a webpage that shows the current weather in TianJin (my city).
- * I found a picture of Tianjin, and also some stikers for the visual elements that I will be using.
  * Added moon, sun, snow, clouds.

  * https://en.picmix.com/

For the final result, I used if & else functions to make the visual elements, created text that shows the information from the API.
